# msaeRB

Implements multivariate ratio benchmarking Small Area Estimation. This
package provides ratio benchmarking estimation for univariate and
multivariate Small Area Estimation and its MSE. In fact, MSE estimators
for ratio renchmark are not readily available, so resampling method that
called parametric bootstrap is applied. The ratio benchmark model and
parametric bootstrap in this package are based on the model proposed in
Small Area Estimaton (J.N.K Rao and Isabel Molina, 2015)

## Installation

```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(msaeRB)
## basic example code
```
